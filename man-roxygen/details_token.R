#' @details To use the 'LIFX' API, you need to get a personal access token from your 'LIFX' account. Usually you save API tokens in your r environment file; that way you only have to enter it once per system.
#' How to get a token:
#' 1. go to \url{https://cloud.lifx.com/sign_in} and sign in (if you do not have an account, you must download the mobile app and register there.
#' 2. generate or look up your access token
#'
#' You do not need to save the token in the environment; you can use all functions in this package by passing a valid `token` argument.
