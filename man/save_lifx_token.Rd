\description{
save a lifx API token in your r environment file
}
\details{
To use the lifx API, you need to get a personal access token from your lifx account. Usually you save API tokens in your r environment file; that way you only have to enter it once per system.
How to get a token:
1. go to \url{https://cloud.lifx.com/sign_in} and sign in (if you do not have an account, you must download the mobile app and register there.
2. generate or look up your access token

You do not need to save the token in the environment; you can use all functions in this package by passing a valid `token` argument.
